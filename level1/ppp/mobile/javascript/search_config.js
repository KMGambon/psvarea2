This set of guidelines covers all CvSU faculty                    members, whether permanent, temporary, or contractual teachers reporting on full                    time.                                       a. At the beginning of each school year, before the start of                                          regular    classes, the college/campus deans shall require                                          the members of    their faculty to decide whether to be on full-                                          time teaching,    research or extension, provided that the                                          needs of instruction are satisfied first and does not lead to                                          extra hiring of personnel.                                       It should be noted, however, that although faculty members are                               classified as full-time teachers, they are still required to conduct either                               research or extension activities on top of their teaching loads. The list of                               those on full-time teaching shall be submitted immediately to the office of                               the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA) while those on full-time                               research or extension shall be endorsed by OVPAA to the Office of the                               Vice President for Research and Development. For efficient allocation of                               funds, tentative computation of faculty workload for instruction shall be                               submitted to OVPAA one week, at the latest, before the start of classes                               in each semester.                                        a. Faculty members with academic ranks who opt for full–time                                          research or extension shall be required to teach minimum of                                          (9) contact hours per week.                                       b. Credit unit load of faculty members on full–time research or                                          extension shall be covered by a separate research and                                          extension workload system of the University.","Section 2. Maximum Workload and Overload Compensation                                      The maximum regular teaching load of an academic full – time                            teaching staff without administrative and supervisory assignment in any                            given semester shall be 18 teaching hours (TCH) per week. (TCH) and                            equivalent WL units shall be reduced to 18 and 25, respectively effective                            First Semester, AY 2004 – 2005 depending on availability of funds). For                            purposes of overload pay, this is equivalent to the maximum of 25                            instruction workload (WL) credit units                   a.  The regular workload of full–time teaching staff in a given  semester      shall                      include only those related to instruction, administrative assignments and other                      services duly supported by designations issued by the Office of the President of                      the University (OUP) as recommended by the vice president concerned.                   b.  Faculty members who opt to be on full-time teaching but who conduct important                      projects under the priority commodity thrusts of the University shall earn credit                      units for those projects based on the guidelines for  research  and   extension                      workload. This credit unit shall be added to  instruction workload provided that                      these credit units are not credited on full-time research.                    c.  The final report on faculty workload, including the summary thereof, shall be                      submitted to the office of the  Vice   President   for  Academic    Affairs  for                      consolidation    within the final examination period of every semester.                    d.  An academic staff who is unable to reach the maximum teaching load per week                      shall be required to teach other courses in other units of the University and/or                      render    other services deemed necessary as recommended by the Vice                      President for Academic Affairs and approved by the University President in order                      to reach the mandatory 40-hour service per week required of all government                      personnel. In no case, however, shall the conduct of other services lead to hiring                      of additional part-time or full-  time faculty member. Hiring will only be done                      when all faculty members are fully loaded at 18 TCH each per week. Exemptions                      to the required 18 TCH, are faculty members with management and supervisory                      designations specified. The assigning of such other services shall be endorsed by                      the Vice President of Academic Affairs for approval by the University President.                    e.  In case faculty members carrying the full load of 18 TCH are given extra teaching                      assignment scheduled outside the official time, such assignment shall be covered                      by a job order in order for the faculty member to receive   equitable                      remuneration.                    f.  The detailed guidelines for faculty workload system shall be prepared, reviewed                      and revised periodically by the Academic Council taking into account the policies                      listed above.","","","","","","","","","","","II.
