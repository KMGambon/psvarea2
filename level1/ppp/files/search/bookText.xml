                           The workload system shall be implemented by the University in line with the
                   guidelines on faculty workload policies and regulations by CHED. The current
                   faculty workload system may be revised or totally replaced upon approval of the
                   Board.

                           The workload system concerns only the instruction function and related
                   activities of the academic teaching staff of Cavite State University. This was
                   finalized on 14 July 2000 incorporating the comments/suggestions of the University
                   Administrative Council during its 03 July 2000 meeting. Amendments and revisions
                   were again made in December 2002 and May 2007 for the following purposes,
                   among others: define credit units for other activities left to the discretion of the
                   College/Campus Dean, specify the mode of payment for overload teaching and
                   overtime teaching; and suggest source of funds for such payment.

                           Section 1. Coverage. This set of guidelines covers all CvSU faculty
                   members, whether permanent, temporary, or contractual teachers reporting on full
                   time.

                                     a. At the beginning of each school year, before the start of
                                         regular    classes, the college/campus deans shall require
                                         the members of    their faculty to decide whether to be on full-
                                         time teaching,    research or extension, provided that the
                                         needs of instruction are satisfied first and does not lead to
                                         extra hiring of personnel.

                                     It should be noted, however, that although faculty members are
                              classified as full-time teachers, they are still required to conduct either

                                   The maximum regular teaching load of an academic full – time

                           First Semester, AY 2004 – 2005 depending on availability of funds). For
                           purposes of overload pay, this is equivalent to the maximum of 25
                           instruction workload (WL) credit units

                 a.  The regular workload of full–time teaching staff in a given  semester      shall
                     include only those related to instruction, administrative assignments and other
                     services duly supported by designations issued by the Office of the President of
                     the University (OUP) as recommended by the vice president concerned.

                 b.  Faculty members who opt to be on full-time teaching but who conduct important
                     projects under the priority commodity thrusts of the University shall earn credit
                     units for those projects based on the guidelines for  research  and   extension
                     workload. This credit unit shall be added to  instruction workload provided that
                     these credit units are not credited on full-time research.


                 c.  The final report on faculty workload, including the summary thereof, shall be
                     submitted to the office of the  Vice   President   for  Academic    Affairs  for
                     consolidation    within the final examination period of every semester.


                 d.  An academic staff who is unable to reach the maximum teaching load per week

                     to reach the mandatory 40-hour service per week required of all government
                     personnel. In no case, however, shall the conduct of other services lead to hiring
                     of additional part-time or full-  time faculty member. Hiring will only be done
                     when all faculty members are fully loaded at 18 TCH each per week. Exemptions

                     designations specified. The assigning of such other services shall be endorsed by

                 e.  In case faculty members carrying the full load of 18 TCH are given extra teaching
                     assignment scheduled outside the official time, such assignment shall be covered
                     by a job order in order for the faculty member to receive   equitable
                     remuneration.
